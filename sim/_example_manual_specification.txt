##Comments are start with ## and are read through.
##Names of functions to be defined start with #
##Definitions of functions continue until the next # or the end of the file.
##Spaces and EOLs are stripped out of functions during parsing, so can be used here for legibility
##***An entirely blank line ends the file.***
##Functions to be defined are lambda functions that accept a fixed series of inputs: [the number of haplotypes in the population]
##Every custom classification must have two classification schemes, one for the first chromosome copy A classification_scheme_A and one for the second chromosome copy B classification_scheme_B, and an exclusion scheme.
##The example below should implement the default HMM
##
##minimum frequency of (1/2n) + 0.0001 where n is the number of individuals.
#minf
(1.0/x1)+0.00001
##0 if different from archaic (4,0) or shared derived with archaic (6,1) and freq in Africa > eta (13, minf + 1e-9, 1.0)
##1 if shared with archaic and archaic target is derived (6,1), and frequency in Africa is < eta (13,0.0, minf).
